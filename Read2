I would like to recommend Mr. Arvindkumar as a candidate for a Master’s program at your esteemed university. I have known him for 3 years during which I have been his lecturer and project guide. He has excellent technical and logical skills, and a vibrant personality. He has always struck me as a person who does things his own way, learning continuously from his mistakes and experiences. 
As a lecturer to Arvindkumar, I found him to be a sincere and disciplined student with a knack for asking good questions in class. He would question anything he didn’t understand, and made sure to understand all topics thoroughly. The courses I took for him (Electronic Circuits and Analog & Digital Circuits laboratory) demanded strong logical reasoning skills and hard-work, and he demonstrated these skills very well. He has a perfect grasp of the foundational topics of Engineering, and I would place him among the top 10% of the students I have taught. I have met very few students who are as enthusiastic about learning as him.
I was his project guide during his final year of Engineering, during which I observed his work ethic. He worked on a Data Science project to determine if a person is subject to coronary heart disease, and compare the performance and accuracy of various classifiers in doing so. He only took 2 weeks to completely research, learn and implement this project. Not only had he shown tremendous effort and dedication to complete it in such a short period of time, but also had continuously kept in touch with the evaluators to update his progress and implemented any improvements or alternative methods that were suggested. 
I’ve known him to participate in many technical fests, quizzes, and volunteering activities inside and outside college. I’ve seen him actively attend technical seminars and workshops pertaining to Data Science and Cloud Computing. He has always utilized the opportunities to interact with seniors, subordinates, and experts in the field.
Arvindkumar stands out as an active, friendly, and energetic person. His confidence and social skills have grown exponentially over the years, making him popular among students and faculty alike. I believe that his thirst for knowledge coupled with his problem-solving and comprehension skills make him an excellent candidate for research, and would strongly recommend his admission into your graduate program. I believe he will strive to succeed and make a mark on technology wherever he goes, and wish him the best of luck. I would be happy to respond to any queries you may have regarding Arvindkumar.

It would be my pleasure to recommend Mr. Arvind for a Master’s degree in Computer Science. Hardworking and eager to learn, he would make a wonderful graduate student. I have observed his character, performance, and behavior, and I can vouch for his excellence in these qualities. He has tremendous potential and motivation for higher studies in the Computer Science field.
I had taught him Artificial Intelligence, during the course of which I assessed his traits. His enthusiasm in class discussions and ideas put forward by him reflect his inquisitiveness and ability to comprehend, break down, and analyze advanced concepts. In fact, I still remember his assignment on Logical Agents in which he showed a thorough understanding of knowledge-based agents and propositional logic, and I use it for reference to this day.  He took time to absorb the whole topic in detail, and managed to put it across eloquently on paper. His interest in the subject and eagerness to learn more and more have convinced me of the genuineness of his desire to study further and the high potential he possesses. 
Arvind’s grasp on fundamental topics is excellent, and he is conceptually and logically very strong. He wouldn’t be hesitant to ask queries and doubts on any topic that he couldn’t comprehend fully or properly. A major component of the Artificial Intelligence class was the Seminar activity, for which students were required to conduct a brief seminar on an AI topic of modern relevance. Not only did he simply present an instructive seminar on xyz, he delivered it in a way that an audience with no background on the topic would be able to comprehend every point he covered. This not only gave me a sense of his articulate speaking skills, but also confirmed his passion and interest in the subject to rigorously learn and understand the topic in a short time-frame, and helping others do so as well.
With regards to project work, I judge Arvind to be innovative, adaptable, and hard-working. He worked on a…… He wrote a technical paper based on the same project as part of his course requirement. The detail presented in the paper was impressive and to the point, characteristic of a well written research paper.
Arvind showed a keen interest in Data Analytics as well. I had reviewed a comprehensive report and research proposal he had prepared for developing a model that would detect, control, and prevent diabetes in rural regions with the help of electronic medical records. “This proposal was deservedly selected to be completed at National Institute of Technology-Karnataka, as well as Motorola Scholarship Program. “
Over the couple of years that I have known him, I have seen Arvind grow from a diffident person into the confident and assertive man he is today. He is well-trained, and strives to learn and improve every day. I’m confident that he will be a worthy asset to any graduate school he ends up attending. I look forward to watching him develop and grow further.
