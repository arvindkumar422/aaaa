I would love to recommend Arvindkumar as a candidate for a seat at your esteemed university. I have known him for 3 years during which I have been his lecturer and project guide. I’ve known him to display excellent logical skills, academic prowess, and a vibrant personality. He has always struck me as a person who does things his own way, learning continuously from his mistakes and experiences. 
As a lecturer to Arvind, I found him to be a sincere and disciplined student with a knack for asking intelligent questions. The courses I took for him (x and y) demanded strong logical reasoning skills and hard-work, and Arvind demonstrated these qualities very well. I also observed that he delved deeper beyond bookish knowledge into any topic that intrigued him. He was diligent and regular, completing his coursework and submitting all his assignments on time. He has a perfect grasp of the foundational topics of Engineering, and has consistently been placed among the top 10% of my classes.
I was his project guide during his final year of Engineering, during which I observed his work ethic. He worked to create a model to classify and compare various methods of classification. Not only had he shown tremendous effort and dedication to complete it, but also continuously kept in touch with the evaluators to update his progress and tried implementing any improvements or alternative methods they suggested. He was more interested to carry it out in the best way possible rather than just finishing it, and this is an example of his strong desire and motivation for learning. 
Arvind stands out as an active, friendly, and energetic person. I’ve known him to participate in many technical fests, quizzes and volunteering activities inside and outside college. I’ve seen him actively attend seminars and quizzes. His confidence and social skills have grown exponentially over the years, making him popular amongst students and faculty alike. 
I believe that Arvind’s thirst for knowledge coupled with his curiosity and comprehension skills make him a worthy candidate for research, and I would strongly recommend his admission into your graduate program. I believe he will strive to succeed and make a mark on technology wherever he goes, and wish him the best of luck. I would be happy to respond to any queries you may have regarding Arvind.






It would be my pleasure to recommend Mr. Arvind for a Master’s degree in Computer Science. Hardworking and eager to learn, he would make a wonderful graduate student. I have observed his character, performance, and behavior, and I can vouch for his excellence in these qualities. He has tremendous potential and motivation for higher studies in the Computer Science field.
I had taught him Artificial Intelligence, during which I assessed his traits. His enthusiasm in class discussions and ideas put forward by him reflect his inquisitiveness and ability to comprehend, break down, and analyze advanced concepts. In fact, I still remember his assignment on Logical Agents in which he showed a thorough understanding of knowledge-based agents and propositional logic, and I use it for reference to this day.  He took time to absorb the whole topic in detail, and managed to put it across eloquently on paper. His interest in the subject and eagerness to learn more and more have convinced me of the genuineness of his desire to study further and the high potential he possesses. 
Arvind’s grasp on fundamental topics is excellent, and he is conceptually and logically very strong. He wouldn’t be hesitant to ask queries and doubts on any topic that he couldn’t comprehend fully or properly. A major component of the Artificial Intelligence class was the Seminar activity, for which students were required to conduct a brief seminar on an AI topic of modern relevance. Not only did he simply present a wonderful seminar on xyz, he delivered it in a way that an audience with no background on the topic would be able to comprehend every point he covered. This not only gave me a sense of his articulate speaking skills, but also confirmed his passion and interest in the subject to put so much rigorously learn and understand the topic, helping others do so as well.
With regards to project work, I judge Arvind to be innovative, adaptable, and hard-working. He worked on a…… He wrote a technical paper based on the same project as part of his course requirement. The detail presented in the paper was impressive and to the point.
Arvind showed a keen interest in Data Analytics as well. I had reviewed a comprehensive report and research proposal he had prepared for developing a model that would detect, control, and prevent diabetes in rural regions with the help of electronic medical records. This proposal was deservedly selected to be completed at National Institute of Technology-Karnataka, as well as Motorola Scholarship Program. 
Initially diffident and low on confidence, I have seen Arvind grow substantially over the couple of years that I’ve known him into the assertive and levelheaded man he is today. He is well-trained, and strives to learn and improve every day. I’m confident that he will be a worthy asset to any graduate school he ends up attending. I look forward to watching him develop and grow further.
