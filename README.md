I would love to recommend Arvindkumar as a candidate for a seat at your esteemed university. I have known Arvind for 3 years, and I have been his lecturer and project guide. During the course of her study, I had the opportunity to observe his logical skills, academic prowess, as well as his vibrant personality. He has always struck me as a person who does things his own way with a strong hunger for learning. 
As a lecturer, I found Arvind to be a sincere and disciplined student with a knack for asking intelligent questions. The courses I took for him (x and y) demanded strong logical reasoning skills and hard-work, and Arvind demonstrated these qualities very well. I also observed that he delved deeper beyond bookish knowledge into any topic that intrigued him. He is a student who diligently completed his coursework and submitted all his assignments and project work on time. He has a perfect grasp of the foundational topics in Computer Engineering, and his performances in my classes as well as outside have made me confident in his ability to achieve many things in this field.
I was his project guide during his final year of Engineering, during which I observed he worked to create a model to classify  heart diseases.
