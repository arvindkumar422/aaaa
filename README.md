I look forward to the opportunity of working in the data science hub at UCSD, where I'd have the opportunity to work on Machine learning and Big data technologies. Using matchpoint feature, I can work with experts on intersting projects or my own.

To be involved at the Center for Machine Learning and Applications (CMLA) in PennState would be a dream for me. I would have the opportunity to research on various ml areas including  classification, clustering,computational biology, and business, while collaborating with experts in the field.

I dream of being involved in The Data Mining and Machine Learning lab (DMML@ASU), where I would not only have significant opportunites to research and work on cutting edge machine learning projects, but have the support, guidance, and assistance from experts in the field. I'm also inspired by The Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing (CUbiC), where I aspire to participate in ML projects to improve healthcare.

I look forward to being involved in Machine Learning and Information Retrieval group.

I am a student who is really interested in taking the Machine Learning course as I aim to pursue a Master's degree in this field after my graduation in college. Being a full time student with no job in a third world country, I would really struggle to pay for the course. My father is the only earning member of the family, and I receive meager allowances for food and internet, leaving me with negligible to no money for purchasing good text-books or take extra courses, even in college. Machine Learning isn't part of the core curriculum at my university, and I cannot afford to take up the elective that needs to be paid for. I want to start learning early and I believe this course by Andrew N G will give me a solid foundation in the field. 

Taking this course would set me up well for the Master's degree that I wish to pursue. The syllabus is well-drilled to include a variety of topics that Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, and this is beneficial not only in acquiring knowledge on a wide range of topics, but also in assessing my interests to focus my career on. Universities would value the completion of online courses, and since Machine Learning is well aligned with my interests, it would really help my profile for application to these universities. Taking this course would tremendously help my job applications for research as well, because this course is well renowned to be the perfect start to the Machine Learning  world, and a certificate of completion would be a testament to my ability to understand thoroughly the foundational topics of Machine Learning. The knowledge imparted by the course instructor is invaluable, and this would be my stepping stone to becoming a researcher in this field.
