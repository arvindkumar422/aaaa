I would love to recommend Arvindkumar as a candidate for a seat at your esteemed university. I have known Arvind for 3 years, and I have been his lecturer and project guide. During the course of her study, I had the opportunity to observe his logical skills, academic prowess, as well as his vibrant personality. He has always struck me as a person who does things his own way with a strong hunger for learning. 
As a lecturer to Arvind, I found him to be a sincere and disciplined student with a knack for asking intelligent questions. The courses I took for him (x and y) demanded strong logical reasoning skills and hard-work, and Arvind demonstrated these qualities very well. I also observed that he delved deeper beyond bookish knowledge into any topic that intrigued him. He is a student who diligently completed his coursework and submitted all his assignments and project work on time. He has a perfect grasp of the foundational topics in Computer Engineering, and his performances in my classes as well as outside have made me confident in his ability to achieve many things in this field.
I was his project guide during his final year of Engineering, during which I had the chance to observe his work. He worked to create a model to classify heart diseases. Xyzxyz. Not only had he shown tremendous effort and dedication to complete it, but also was continuously in touch with the evaluators to be level with his progress and tried implementing any improvements/alternative methods they suggested. He was more interested to carry it out in the best way possible rather than just finishing it, and this made me appreciate his desire and motivation for learning. 
He also utilizes opportunities to interact with seniors, subordinates, and experts from the field. (pramod, srikar stuff)
Arvind stands out as a very active, friendly and energetic person. I’ve known him to participate in many technical fests, quizzes and volunteering activities in and outside college. I’ve seen him actively attend seminars and quizzes which made me recognize his drive to acquire and retain knowledge. These interests have also been reflected in his scholastic pursuits. His confidence and public speaking skills have grown exponentially over the years. He has a friendly and mature personality, and is very popular amongst students and faculty as well. I believe that Arvind’s thirst for knowledge coupled with his curiosity and comprehension skills make him a suitable candidate for research, and I would strongly recommend his admission into your graduate program. I believe he will strive to succeed and make a mark on technology wherever he goes, and wish him the best of luck. I would be happy to respond to any queries you may have regarding Arvind.

I am a student who is really interested in taking the Machine Learning course as I aim to pursue a Master's degree in this field after my graduation in college. Being a full time student with no job in a third world country, I would really struggle to pay for the course. My father is the only earning member of the family, and I receive meager allowances for food and internet, leaving me with negligible to no money for purchasing good text-books or take extra courses, even in college. Machine Learning isn't part of the core curriculum at my university, and I cannot afford to take up the elective that needs to be paid for. I want to start learning early and I believe this course by Andrew N G will give me a solid foundation in the field. 

Taking this course would set me up well for the Master's degree that I wish to pursue. The syllabus is well-drilled to include a variety of topics that Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, and this is beneficial not only in acquiring knowledge on a wide range of topics, but also in assessing my interests to focus my career on. Universities would value the completion of online courses, and since Machine Learning is well aligned with my interests, it would really help my profile for application to these universities. Taking this course would tremendously help my job applications for research as well, because this course is well renowned to be the perfect start to the Machine Learning  world, and a certificate of completion would be a testament to my ability to understand thoroughly the foundational topics of Machine Learning. The knowledge imparted by the course instructor is invaluable, and this would be my stepping stone to becoming a researcher in this field.
